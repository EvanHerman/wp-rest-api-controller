* Refactor much of the codebase.

* Fixing uninstall issue.

= 2.0.0 - March 12th, 2019 =

* The restriction of using dashes in post/term meta has been removed.
* The restriction of protected meta fields has been removed.

= WP REST API Controller v1.4.2 - February 2rd, 2019 =
* Update rest_endpoint_base static string to wp-core get_rest_url() flexible url

= v1.4.1 - February 23rd, 2017 =
* A new filter has been added: `wp_rest_api_controller_retrieve_meta_single`. This controls the `$single` argument for the `get_post_meta()` function. Please note: if you want to see all of the values for repeating meta key fields (i.e. multiple entries in the postmeta table corresponding to the same key) you *need to use this filter* and return false. If you don't you will only retrieve the first value. For more information, see the FAQ "How do I retrieve repeating postmeta fields."

= v1.4.0 - January 18th, 2017 =
* Default `posts` and `pages` are no longer controllable with this plugin (this change is due to future WordPress Core development leveraging the REST API). As a result, both endpoints will be enabled and all post meta customizations will be lost on update.
* Added array of 'always enabled' posts and an associated filter `wp_rest_api_controller_always_enabled_post_types`. By default, post, page, revision, nav_menu_item, custom_css, customize_changeset, and attachment post types are always enabled.
* Added logic to handle empty post meta names to prevent all post meta fields from being displayed
* Added logic to handle uppercase letters in customized post meta names

= v1.1.0 - July 10th, 2016 =
* Added the ability to clear cache when new post types/meta data have been registered.
* Added admin notices to help clarify what happened.
* Bumped version number to v1.1.0.

= v1.0.0 =
